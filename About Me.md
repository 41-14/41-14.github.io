<h2 id="content">Education</h2>
<p>I studied Geography at the University of Florida with a focus in Geographic Information Systems. I ended up in Geography after completing "What is the Good Life?" with Dr. Jane Southworth and switching from Statistics.  Dr. Southworth, along with the rest of the Geography department have taught me so much and to expand upon this knowledge I have started a master’s degree in Data Science at DePaul University. </p>

		<h3>Hobbies</h3>
				<p>In my free time, I like to collect and listen to vinyl, ride peloton, and take my dog to the dog park. My vinyl collection is currently small at about 70 records but is growing everyday and my dog is a very high energy two year old Siberian Husky named Niamh. I also play guitar and bass. </p>

		<h3>Sports</h3>
<p>I am a big fan of sports. I credit that largely to going to the University of Florida where I closely follow Men’s Basketball and Football. At the professional level I am a fan of the following teams: the Ravens and the Orioles (family from Baltimore), Nets (Chiozza) and Arsenal. I try to attend every Gators' home game and have succeeded both during my undergrad and after graduation. In the url, 41-14 is a reference to the score that UF demolished the Ohio State University by to win a national championship.</p>	</div>

		<h3>Hometown</h3>
<p>I was born in Martin County, Florida where I lived until I started Undergrad. It is a beautiful area on the coast down south that I hope to return to when I am older. However, currently I love living in Gainesville as it has a good ratio of people to traffic along with a young, educated, and diverse demographic.</p>	</div>
	<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>R vs Python</h3>
I have a strong preference to use Python over R. I really like python’s syntax and flow; it just really interfaces with how I think. I think this might have to do with which one I learned first but can’t be sure. I am glad however, that I was compelled to learn both because I think it allows me able to work in the one most optimal for a given task.</p>	</div>

		<h3>Employment</h3>
<p>I am currently working as a Data Analyst/Tableau developer at a Civil Engineering firm. I am so lucky to have been given this opportunity right out of school and to be able to have grown from GIS into Data Analytics. However, I think the field isn’t the right fit for me and hope to be able branch out in the future.</p>	</div>
