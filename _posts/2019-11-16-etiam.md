Las Vegas was an amazing experience. I am glad to have been given the opportunity to attend Tableau Conference and to experience so many state and national parks out west. 

Highlights of the trip included:

Scrambling Calico Tank Trail at Red Rock National Conservation Area – I think scrambling will eventually be my favorite hobby.

Summiting Angel’s Landing at Zion National Park.

Watching the Iron Viz Competition at the Conference.

I came back with a lot of new experiences and picked up a lot of new techniques and information about the future of BI.

So lucky to have gone. I hope to go again someday!
